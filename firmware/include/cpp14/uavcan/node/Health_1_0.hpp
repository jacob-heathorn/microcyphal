// | This implementation uses a minimal variant implementation that is forward-compatible with the same types generated
// | using the C++17 variant type in the standard library. This minimal variant implementation is limited in the
// | following ways:
// |    1. Supports only emplace and get_if.
// |    2. Only support access by index (see the IndexOf property of the VariantType).
// |    3. This object cannot be copy-constructed nor move-constructed.
// |    4. There is an O(n) lookup in this object's destructor and in the
// |       emplace method.
// |
// | The C++17 version of this object will define the same emplace and get_if wrappers so code written against this
// | version will be fully-forward compatible, but the C++17 version exposes the variant type directly allowing full
// | use of that standard library feature – it is therefore not backwards-compatible.
